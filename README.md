# AIPI 590 – Emerging Trends in Explainable AI (Fall 2025)

This repository contains my work for **AIPI 590: Emerging Trends in Explainable AI**, taught by Dr. Brinnae Bent at Duke University in Fall 2025.  
The course explores **interpretability, transparency, adversarial robustness, alignment, and human–AI interaction** through hands-on assignments, readings, and a final project.
